# FinderWindowFun

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aureliojargas/finder-window-fun/master/shots/all-tabs.png)

AppleScript toy to move/resize Finder windows.

It was coded in 2010, using Xcode's AppleScriptObjC bridge. It used to work in my Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

I haven't touched the code since then.

As far as I remember the code was 100% working and stable, but I never bothered to make the final polish for a formal release: documentation, website, artwork, etc, so it's just an abandoned unreleased software.

I'm publishing the code hoping that it could be useful for those learning the AppleScript language.
